3.4.2
  - Decreased amount of network requests during startup.

  - Added getCall(String) to CallClient, which returns the Call object
      for the given callId, if that call exists.

  - Added getHeaders() to Call, which returns the custom headers for the
      call.

  - Sample apps have been updated to include a more robust implementation
      where the SinchClient is contained inside a Service.

3.3.9

      internal REST API requests has completed, but the requests completes
      later during the graceful termination period.

3.3.8
  - Added new method SinchClient.terminateGracefully()

3.3.7
  - Fixed issue causing long call setup time when using certain codecs.

      a call.

  - Increased logging for rare instances where AudioTrack/AudioRecord would
      not initialize correctly.

  - Fixed crash when attempting to send DTMF during call setup.

  - Incoming calls will from now on never have state PROGRESSING.
      Previously, incoming calls could either be in INITIATING or PROGRESSING
      just after CallClientListener.onIncomingCall.
      Now, the call will initially be in INITIATING, until
      transitioning to ESTABLISHED or ENDED.

3.2.4
  - Fixed bug that prevented creating SinchClient via the Builder without
    specifying an application secret up front.

3.2.3

      after terminate() (or stop()) is called and may not be started
      again.

  - SecurityExceptions thrown on network requests are caught
      internally in the SDK now, workaround for a potential
      Android bug that sometimes throws SecurityException when
      it should throw an exception related to unknown host.

      if no error occurred.

3.0.1
  - Removed internal call to AudioManager.setMode() when
      establishing/tearing down a call.

  - Support for sending Instant Messages to multiple recipients.
      See WritableMessage.addRecipient()

  - Instantiating a SinchClient is done via a SinchClientBuilder.
      See Sinch.getSinchClientBuilder().

  - Calling functionality moved to interface CallClient.

  - Calling is now disabled by default (to be consistent with
      Instant Messaging).
      Enable it with SinchClient.setSupportCalling(true)

  - Renamed CallListener.onCallReceivedOnRemoteEnd(Call) to
      CallListener.onCallProgressing(Call)

  - All methods to used to manage listeners (SinchClientListnener,
      CallClientListener, MessageClientListener) now conforms
      to the method naming convention addXXXListener,
      removeXXXListener.

  - MessageClientListener.onMessageFailed no longer takes a list
      of List<MessageFailureInfo>, but a single entry.
      The method may be invoked multiple times instead.

  - MessageClientListener.onMessageSent is now passed the
      recipientId as a third argument.

  - Removed method CallListener.onCallAnswered(Call).
      Any logic that was performed in relation to this method
      should be moved to where Call.answer() is invoked.
